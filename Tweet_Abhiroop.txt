France and Germany playing in that unbearable heat were more spirited than this Columbian team. Learn from the hosts. #Brasil #BRAvsCOL
The German team a well oiled machine... France played well. But there's only one winner
_M hehehe. True. True.
_M cruel it was. Enough with the last minute drama.
_M you had to say it. Now the Dutch equalize. Happy?

But all rivalries apart, this is embarrassing!No hopes for English teams in European championships if they play like this.
You're playing at Stamford Bridge Mr.Wenger.Not a walk in the park.
